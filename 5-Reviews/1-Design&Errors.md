### Software Development Life Cycle

- Requirement
- Design
- Implementation
- Test
  - cover all scenarios
- Deploy
- Maintenance


### Type of Bugs

- compile-time error
  - syntax error
    - grammar error
    - parameter error
    - accessing error (private/static/final)
- run-time error
  - exceptions
    - divide by 0
    - file not found
    - infinite loops
- intent or logic error
  - hardest to fix…

### Robustness

- Give good answers for good inputs
- Won't crash on bad inputs
- Won't allow execution on bad inputs

### Object Oriented Design

- Classes need to make sense
- Identify behaviors (methods)
  - Find the verbs…
- Determine relationships
  - UML diagrams
    - is-a
    - has-a
- Implementing Classes
  - Bottom-up development
  - Top-down development
- Implementing Methods
  - information hiding
  - stub method (temporary place holder)
  - algorithm

### Program Analysis

- Assertions
  - pre-condition
  - post-condition
- Efficiency
  - time
    - reading data usually is fast
    - writing/moving data usually is slow
  - space (memory/storage usage)
- Readability
  - Easy to understand
  - Easy to fix/update
